# AI Motivational Quote Generator

This project is a simple **AI-based Motivational Quote Generator** built using the **GPT-2 language model**.

The application generates motivational quotes based on a user-provided keyword such as **Peace**, **Success**, or **Health**.

Since GPT-2 works best by continuing patterns rather than following instructions, the prompt design is optimized to guide sentence completion.

## Features
- Keyword-based quote generation  
- GPT-2 optimized prompt engineering  
- Clean and readable quote output  
- Simple command-line interface  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- GPT-2  

## How It Works
1. User enters a keyword  
2. GPT-2 completes a guided sentence  
3. The output is cleaned and displayed as a quote  

## Note
This project demonstrates basic **text generation**, **prompt engineering**, and the limitations of early transformer models.
