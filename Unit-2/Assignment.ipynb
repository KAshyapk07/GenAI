      "1. **Understanding the Error**: An `IndexError` in Python occurs when you try to access an element in a sequence (like a list or tuple) using an index that does not exist.\n",
      "2. **Locating the Issue**: The error is happening on line 5 of your script, which implies that there's an indexing operation on that line that's going out of bounds.\n",
      "3. **Possible Causes**: The most common reasons for this error include:\n",
      "    - Attempting to access an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the list.\n",
      "    - Trying to access a negative index that is less than the negative length of the list.\n",
